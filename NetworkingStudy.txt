Slides 1
What is internet
    - millions of connected computing devices 
    - hosts = end systems 
    - infrastructure that provides services to applications 
    - provids programming interface to apps
    - network of networks 
whats a protocol
    - define format order of msgs send and received among netowrk entities and 
        actions taken on msg transmission, receipt 
network structure
    - network edge = hosts clients and servers serves often in data centers
    - way to access networks physical media, wired wireless communication links
    - network core = interconnected routers network of networks 
Slides 2 
wireless access networks 
    - shared wireless access network connects end system to router 
    - LANS 100ft radius spped 54 mbps 
    - wide area wireless access 10's km speed 1-10mps 4g/lte 5g
Radio
    - signal is carred in electromagnetics spectrum
    - bidirectional
    - propagation environment effects: reflection, obstruction by objects, interference 
    - radio link types: terrestrial microwave(45mbps channels)
        - LAN - 11mps, 54mbps
        - wide area 3g cellular 
        - satelite kbps to 45 mbps 270msec end to end delay 
Fiber, coax
    - coax two concentric copper conductors, bidirectional, boradband (multiple channels on cable)
    - fiber glass fiber carrying lfight pulses each pulse is a bit, high speed operation 10-100s of gbps transmission rate
        low error rate
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORE AND HASH NETWORK
network core
    - mesh of interconnected routers 
    - hosts break application layer messages into packets 
        forwawrd packets from one router to the next across links on path from source
        to destination
hosts 
    - send packets of data, takes application messages
    - breaks into smaller chunks known as packets of length l bits
    - transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R
    FORMULA 
    time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L(bits) / R(bits/sec)
VERY IMPORTANT 
Packet switching store and forward 
    - takes L/R seconds to transmit L-bit packet into link at R bps
    - store and foreward - entire packet must arrive at router before it can be trasmitted on next link
    - each packet is transmitted at full link capacity 
Packet loss occurence because packet arrival rate to link temporarily exceeds output link capacity 
    which causes a queue for packets to wait their turn
    loss occurs when there are no free buffers 
COMPARE CIRCUIT AND PACKET SWITCHING 
Circuit switching 
    - end to end resources allocated to reserved for call between source and destination 
    - dedicated resources no sharing, circuit like guaranteed performance
    - circuit segment idle if not used by call
    - commonly used in traditional telephone networks
Packet switching 
    - good for bursty data 
    - resource sharing 
    - simpler no call setup
    - excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss 
        - protocals needed for reliable data transfer congestion control

Slides 3
1-13
Packet switching 
    - queuing and loss: if arrival rate to link exceeds trasnmission rate of link for a period of time
        - packets will queue wait to be trasmitted on link
        - packets can be dropped if memory (buffer) fills up
1-14 very important calculation questions on this 
d nodal = d proc + d queue + d trans + d prop
1-16 question 

slides 4
Throughput 
    - rate at which bits transferred between sender and receiver 
        - instantaneous - rate at given point in time
        - average - rate over longer period of time
        server sends bits into pipe -> pipe can carry fluid at rate Rs b/s -> pipe that can carry fluid at rate Rc b/s
internet protocol stack
    - application: supporting network applications 
        - ftp smtp http
    - transport: process-process data transfer 
        - tcp udp
    - netowkr: routing of datagrams from source to destination 
        - ip routing protocols 
    - link - data transfer between neighboring network elements 
    - physical: bits on the wire
DDos 
    - attackers make resources unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelimg resource with bogus traffic 
Packet sniffing 
    - promiscuous network interface reads/records all packets 
IP spoofing 
    - send packet with false source address
